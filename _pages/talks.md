Edinburgh, March 2024\
<p>**<a href="/assets/pdf/STAMP_Mar24.pdf" target="_blank">Slides</a>** containing an introduction to Lagrangian one-forms, the theory of Lie dialgebras, the construction of a general Lagrangian one-form living on a coadjoint orbit, and an illustration of this construction for the finite rational Gaudin model. Based on **<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07339" target="_self">joint work</a>** with Vincent Caudrelier and Marta Dell'Atti.</p>
