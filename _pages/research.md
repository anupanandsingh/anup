<h4>Lagrangian multiforms, integrability, and quantisation</h4>

Much of my current work is rooted in the <b><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01076717" target="_self">$$r$$-matrix</a></b> approach to integrable systems and the theory of <b><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.4086" target="_self">Lagrangian multiforms</a></b>. Together with my doctoral supervisor Dr. Vincent Caudrelier and our collaborators, I am developing a framework for constructing Lagrangian multiforms in a systematic manner, which, in general, is a rather non-trivial task. Incorporating ingredients and ideas from the Hamiltonian framework -- in particular, the theory of Lie dialgebras -- we have achieved <b><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07339" target="_self">this</a></b> for a large class of finite-dimensional integrable systems.

A long*ish*-term goal of my doctoral project is to employ this framework together with the path integral formalism to quantise integrable theories in a covariant manner.

<h4>Causal set theory</h4>

As a visiting student at the Raman Research Institute in 2019-2020, Bengaluru, I worked on causal set theory, an approach to quantum gravity that postulates that spacetime is fundamentally discrete and replaces the spacetime continuum with locally finite partially ordered sets. The <b><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07623" target="_self">result</a></b> from this project, a collaboration with Dr. Abhishek Mathur and Prof. Sumati Surya, helped establish that certain classes of non-manifold-like causal sets are suppressed even though they are more typical than manifold-like causal sets.

<h4>Black holes, information scrambling, and quantum chaos</h4>

Prior to that, I was a part of the five-year BS-MS dual degree programme at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Pune. I spent my final year of the programme at the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS-TIFR), Bengaluru, under the guidance of Prof. Spenta Wadia, learning how to think about physics. As a part of my <b><a href="http://dr.iiserpune.ac.in:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/1047/MS%20Thesis%20-%20Anup%20Anand%20Singh.pdf" target="_self">MS thesis</a></b> work done under his supervision, I tried to better understand the scrambling of information by black holes using ideas from holography, quantum information and chaotic dynamics. A novel result from the project was a derivation of the effective action of the charged version of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model achieved by reducing the original theory of Majorana fermions to a theory of bilocal fields.
