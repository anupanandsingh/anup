<h4>Lagrangian multiforms, integrability, and quantisation</h4>

Much of my current work is rooted in the <b><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01076717" target="_self">$$r$$-matrix</a></b> approach to integrable systems and the theory of <b><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.4086" target="_self">Lagrangian multiforms</a></b>. Together with my doctoral supervisor Dr. Vincent Caudrelier and our collaborators, I am developing a framework for constructing Lagrangian multiforms in a systematic manner, which is a rather non-trivial task, in general. Incorporating ingredients and ideas from the Hamiltonian framework for integrability -- in particular, the theory of Lie dialgebras -- we have achieved <b><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07339" target="_self">this</a></b> for a large class of finite-dimensional integrable systems.

At the moment, I am working towards incorporating affine models into our framework. A related long*ish*-term goal is to use our construction together with the path integral formalism to quantise integrable field theories in a covariant manner.

<h4>Causal set theory</h4>

As a visiting student at the Raman Research Institute (RRI), Bengaluru, I worked on <b><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11544" target="_self">causal set theory</a></b>, an approach to quantum gravity that postulates that spacetime is fundamentally discrete and replaces the spacetime continuum with locally finite posets. However, non-manifold-like causal sets are far more typical than manifold-like ones -- this poses a challenge to causal set theory, since continuum-like dynamics must arise from the fundamentally discrete dynamics in the semi-classical limit. A <b><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07623" target="_self">result</a></b> from my collaboration with Dr. Abhishek Mathur and Prof. Sumati Surya at RRI, helped establish that certain classes of non-manifold-like causal sets are suppressed even though they are more typical than manifold-like causal sets, allowing for the possibility that the causal set path-sum can lead to emergent manifold-like behavior.

<h4>Black holes, information scrambling, and quantum chaos</h4>

For my <b><a href="http://dr.iiserpune.ac.in:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/1047/MS%20Thesis%20-%20Anup%20Anand%20Singh.pdf" target="_self">MS thesis</a></b> work done under the supervision of Prof. Spenta Wadia at the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS-TIFR), Bengaluru, I tried to better understand the <b><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0808.2096" target="_self">scrambling of information</a></b> by black holes using ideas from holography, quantum information and chaotic dynamics. A new result from the project was a derivation of the effective action of the charged version of the <b><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07818" target="_self">Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</a></b> achieved by reducing the original theory of Majorana fermions to a theory of bilocal fields.
