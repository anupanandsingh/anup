<h4>Lagrangian multiforms, integrability, and quantisation</h4>

Much of my current work is rooted in the **<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01076717" target="_self">$$r$$-matrix</a>** approach to integrable systems and the theory of **<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.4086" target="_self">Lagrangian multiforms</a>**. Lagrangian multiforms provide a variational description of integrable hierarchies using a generalised action and a variational principle. Together with my doctoral supervisor Dr. Vincent Caudrelier and our collaborators, I am developing a framework for constructing Lagrangian multiforms in a systematic manner, which is a rather non-trivial task, in general. Incorporating ingredients and ideas from the Hamiltonian framework for integrability -- in particular, the theory of Lie dialgebras -- we have achieved **<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07339" target="_self">this</a>** for a large class of finite-dimensional integrable systems. At the moment, I am working towards incorporating affine models into our framework. A related long*ish*-term goal is to use our construction together with the path integral formalism to quantise integrable field theories in a covariant manner.

<h4>Causal set theory</h4>

As a visiting scholar at the Raman Research Institute, Bengaluru, I worked on **<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11544" target="_self">causal set theory</a>**, an approach to quantum gravity that postulates that spacetime is fundamentally discrete and replaces the spacetime continuum with locally finite posets. If one were to randomly pick a poset from the space of all finite posets, it would far more likely be non-manifold-like. This poses a challenge to causal set theory, since one expects continuum-like dynamics to arise in its classical limit. A **<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07623" target="_self">result</a>** from my collaboration with Dr. Abhishek Mathur and Prof. Sumati Surya helped establish that certain classes of non-manifold-like causal sets are suppressed in the causal set path sum despite being more typical that manifold-like ones, making the emergence of manifold-like behavior possible without any restrictions.

<h4>Black holes, information scrambling, and quantum chaos</h4>

For my **<a href="http://dr.iiserpune.ac.in:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/1047/MS%20Thesis%20-%20Anup%20Anand%20Singh.pdf" target="_self">MS thesis</a>** work done under the supervision of Prof. Spenta Wadia at the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS-TIFR), Bengaluru, I tried to better understand the **<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0808.2096" target="_self">scrambling of information</a>** by black holes using ideas from holography, quantum information and chaotic dynamics. A new result from the project was a derivation of the effective action of the charged version of the **<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07818" target="_self">Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</a>** achieved by reducing the original theory of Majorana fermions to a theory of bilocal fields.
