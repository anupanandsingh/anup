<h4>Lagrangian multiforms, integrability, and quantisation</h4>

Despite its usefulness and elegance as a mathematical framework to describe our physical universe, the Lagrangian formalism has traditionally found little utility in the theory of integrable systems. Over the decades, our investigations into the mathematical underpinnings of integrability have instead been almost completely tied to the Hamiltonian formalism. Much of my current work is rooted in the theory of Lagrangian multiforms, a relatively new framework that captures integrability purely from a variational perspective.

The theory marks an important departure from the traditional point of view on integrability that has been based on the Hamiltonian formalism. Moreover, the Lagrangian multiform approach allows for the possibility of using path integrals to quantise integrable theories in a covariant manner, overcoming the drawback of canonical quantisation which breaks the Lorentz covariance of the underlying spacetime coordinates.

We believe to have taken a good <b><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07339" target="_self">first step</a></b> in this direction: using the theory of Lie dialgebras as a guiding principle, we have been able to develop a framework that can be used to construct Lagrangian multiforms of finite-dimensional integrable systems starting from just the bare essential algebraic data.

<h4>Causal set theory</h4>

As a visiting student at the Raman Research Institute in 2019-2020, Bengaluru, I worked on causal set theory, an approach to quantum gravity that postulates that spacetime is fundamentally discrete and replaces the spacetime continuum with locally finite partially ordered sets. The <b><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07623" target="_self">result</a></b> from this project, a collaboration with Dr. Abhishek Mathur and Prof. Sumati Surya, helped establish that certain classes of non-manifold-like causal sets are suppressed even though they are more typical than manifold-like causal sets.

<h4>Black Holes, Information Scrambling, and Quantum chaos</h4>

Prior to that, I was a part of the five-year BS-MS dual degree programme at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Pune. I spent my final year of the programme at the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS-TIFR), Bengaluru, under the guidance of Prof. Spenta Wadia, learning how to think about physics. As a part of my <b><a href="http://dr.iiserpune.ac.in:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/1047/MS%20Thesis%20-%20Anup%20Anand%20Singh.pdf" target="_self">MS thesis</a></b> work done under his supervision, I tried to better understand the scrambling of information by black holes using ideas from holography, quantum information and chaotic dynamics. A novel result from the project was a derivation of the effective action of the charged version of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model achieved by reducing the original theory of Majorana fermions to a theory of bilocal fields.
