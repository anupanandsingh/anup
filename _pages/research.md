<h4>Lagrangian multiforms, integrability, and quantisation</h4>

<details>

<summary>Much of my current work is rooted in the $$r$$-matrix approach to integrable systems and the theory of Lagrangian multiforms. The <b><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01076717" target="_self">classical $$r$$-matrix</a></b> -- introduced by E. K. Sklyanin in the 1970s -- is an intriguing object that brings important algebraic and geometric insights into the study of integrable systems.</summary> The notion of Lagrangian multiforms, on the other hand, is relatively more recent and aims to capture integrability purely from a variational point of view, using a generalised variational principle applied to an appropriate generalisation of a classical action.

Writing down Lagrangian multiform for a given integrable system in a systematic manner is a non-trivial task. A part of my work is aimed at constructing a framework that can provide an efficient way of describing all the Lagrangian coefficients in one formula. Using the theory of Lie dialgebras as guiding principle, we have achieved <b><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07339" target="_self">this</a></b> for a large class of finite-dimensional integrable systems.

Together with V. Caudrelier, my doctoral supervisor, and our collaborators, I am also exploring connections between our Lie dialgebra-based framework and the gauge-theoretic approach to integrability that has...

another approach was introduced which takes a more global view on a hi- erarchy and provides an efficient way of describing all the Lagrangian coefficients in one for- mula [12, 14], see also [16]. A key insight in [12, 14] was the incorporation in the Lagrangian multiform of key ingredients known in the Hamiltonian framework for integrable hierarchies, in particular the classical r-matrix, as well as the “compounding” of hierarchies following [20].

we show how the theory of Lie dialgebras [21] can be used to construct systematically a Lagrangian multiform for any finite-dimensional system which falls within the Lie dialgebra framework.

Finally, a long*ish*-term goal of my doctoral project is to employ the new set of ideas that the theory of Lagrangian multiforms bring to the discussion to explore the the possibility of using path integrals to quantise integrable theories in a covariant manner, overcoming the drawback of canonical quantisation which breaks the Lorentz covariance of the underlying spacetime coordinates.

<h4>Causal set theory</h4>

As a visiting student at the Raman Research Institute in 2019-2020, Bengaluru, I worked on causal set theory, an approach to quantum gravity that postulates that spacetime is fundamentally discrete and replaces the spacetime continuum with locally finite partially ordered sets. The <b><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.07623" target="_self">result</a></b> from this project, a collaboration with Dr. Abhishek Mathur and Prof. Sumati Surya, helped establish that certain classes of non-manifold-like causal sets are suppressed even though they are more typical than manifold-like causal sets.

<h4>Black holes, information scrambling, and quantum chaos</h4>

Prior to that, I was a part of the five-year BS-MS dual degree programme at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Pune. I spent my final year of the programme at the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS-TIFR), Bengaluru, under the guidance of Prof. Spenta Wadia, learning how to think about physics. As a part of my <b><a href="http://dr.iiserpune.ac.in:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/1047/MS%20Thesis%20-%20Anup%20Anand%20Singh.pdf" target="_self">MS thesis</a></b> work done under his supervision, I tried to better understand the scrambling of information by black holes using ideas from holography, quantum information and chaotic dynamics. A novel result from the project was a derivation of the effective action of the charged version of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model achieved by reducing the original theory of Majorana fermions to a theory of bilocal fields.
