<h4> **Ma**thematical **P**hysics at **Le**eds <br> Seminar Series</h4>

Launched February 2024, MaPLe is an attempt to foster interactions among researchers from across the University of Leeds to give talks on themes in mathematical physics, broadly construed.

Talks are held every other Tuesday from 11:00 to 12:00 in the MALL on Level 8 in the main building of the School of Mathematics.
