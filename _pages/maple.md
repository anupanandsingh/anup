The **Ma**thematical **P**hysics at **Le**eds Seminar Series is aimed at bringing together speakers at any level from across the University of Leeds — from both mathematics and physics departments alike — to give talks on themes in mathematical physics, broadly construed.

Starting February 20, 2024, talks will be held every other Tuesday from 11:00 to 12:00 in the MALL on Level 8 in the main building of the School of Mathematics.
