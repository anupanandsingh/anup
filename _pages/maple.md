The **Ma**thematical **P**hysics at **Le**eds Seminar Series is aimed at bringing together researchers at any level from across the University of Leeds — from both mathematics and physics departments alike — to give talks on themes in mathematical physics, broadly construed. On occasion, we also host seminars by researchers from outside the University of Leeds. Talks are held every other Tuesday from 10:00 to 11:00 in the MALL on Level 8 in the main building of the School of Mathematics.

The series is being organised by **<a href="https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths/staff/14138/dr-linden-disney-hogg" target="_self">Linden Disney-Hogg</a>** and **<a href="https://anupanand.space/" target="_self">Anup Anand Singh</a>**. Slides/notes from the talks will be made available on the **<a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/_#/files/19:6744754bd5754d0294a5d896b2203e8a@thread.v2?ctx=chat" target="_self">MaPLe Teams chat</a>**. If you would like to give a seminar or want to be added to the chat and the mailing list, just drop an email to **a.l.disney-hogg[at]leeds.ac.uk** or **mmaasi[at]leeds.ac.uk**.

Anyons are quasiparticles in two-dimensional systems that show statistical properties very distinct from those of bosons or fermions. While their isolated observation has not yet been achieved, it is possible to perform quantum simulations with physical systems that reveal central properties of anyons. In this talk I will present encoding and manipulation of anyons with quantum technology platforms that reveal their exotic statistical properties with the goal of eventually employing them for topological quantum computation.
