Physics and mathematics inspire each other in beautiful ways. It is this interplay between the two that draws me to mathematical physics, the broad area of my doctoral research. More specifically, I work with ideas rooted in the theory of integrability while drawing inspiration (and borrowing tools) from algebra and geometry.

Under the supervision of Dr. Vincent Caudrelier and Prof. Frank Nijhoff, I am exploring the theory of Lagrangian multiforms, a relatively new framework that captures integrability purely from a variational perspective...
