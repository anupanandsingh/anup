Physics and mathematics inspire each other in beautiful ways. It is this interplay between the two that draws me to integrability, the broad area of my doctoral research. An integrable system -- characterised by a set of equations that can be "solved exactly" -- is highly symmetrical and has fascinating mathematical structures. And while integrability in the natural world is rare, it offers great insights into the fundamental principles underlying the laws of nature. Together with my doctoral supervisors and collaborators, I am currently trying to further our understanding of what are called classical integrable theories and devise a framework for their covariant quantisation.
