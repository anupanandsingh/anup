Physics and mathematics inspire each other in beautiful ways. It is this interplay between the two that draws me to mathematical physics, the broad area of my doctoral research. Together with my doctoral supervisor Dr. Vincent Caudrelier, I am trying to further our understanding of what are called classical integrable theories and devise a framework for their covariant quantisation.

An integrable model -- characterised by a set of equations that can be solved exactly -- is highly symmetrical and has fascinating mathematical structures. And while most integrable theories are only toy models -- and not "true" theories describing physical laws -- they offer great insights into the fundamental principles underlying the laws of nature.

You can check out my *[Research](http://anupanand.space/research/)* page to find out more about the ideas I am pursuing at the moment and some that I have spent time thinking about in the past.
