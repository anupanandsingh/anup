Physics and mathematics inspire each other in beautiful ways. It is this interplay between the two that draws me to mathematical physics, the broad area of my doctoral research. More specifically, I work with ideas rooted in the theory of integrability while drawing inspiration (and borrowing tools) from algebra and geometry. An integrable model -- characterised by a set of equations that can be solved exactly -- is highly symmetrical. Such systems are rare but have intriguing mathematical structures.

Although most integrable theories are only toy models -- and not true theories describing physical laws -- they offer great insights into the fundamental aspects of the principles governing nature.

And while from the point of view of understanding the fundamental laws of nature, they may simply appear to be toy models, they

Integrable systems --characterised by sets of equations that are exactly solvable are rather rare, but they are extremely symmetrical.  



At the heart of physics lies the notion of symmetry. An integrable model -- characterised by a set of equations that can be solved exactly -- have a large number of symmetries. They have intriguing mathematical structures.

While integrable models -- models with

Under the supervision of Dr. Vincent Caudrelier and Prof. Frank Nijhoff, I am exploring the theory of Lagrangian multiforms, a relatively new framework that captures integrability purely from a variational perspective...
