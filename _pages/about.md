Physics and mathematics inspire each other in beautiful ways. It is this interplay between the two that draws me to mathematical physics, a broad discipline that explores how mathematical ideas help us gain insights into the physical laws of nature.

I am currently working towards my PhD under the guidance of Prof. Frank Nijhoff and Dr. Vincent Caudrelier.

Previously, I have worked on aspects of chaos in field theory and gravity as a part of my Master's thesis work under the guidance of the wonderful Prof. Spenta Wadia.
