Physics and mathematics inspire each other in beautiful ways. It is this interplay between the two that draws me to mathematical physics, the broad area of my doctoral research. Together with my doctoral supervisor Dr. Vincent Caudrelier, I am trying to further our understanding of what are called classical integrable theories and devise a framework for their covariant quantisation.

An integrable model -- characterised by a set of equations that can be solved exactly -- is highly symmetrical and has fascinating mathematical structures. And while most integrable theories are only toy models -- and not "true" theories describing physical laws -- they offer great insights into the fundamental principles underlying the laws of nature. 

Much of my current work is rooted in the theory of Lagrangian multiforms, a relatively new framework that captures integrability purely from a variational perspective. This marks an important departure from the traditional point of view on integrability that has been based on the Hamiltonian formalism. Moreover, the Lagrangian multiform approach allows for the possibility of using path integrals to quantise integrable theories in a covariant manner, overcoming the drawback of canonical quantisation which breaks the Lorentz covariance of the underlying spacetime coordinates.

Previously, I have worked on causal set theory, on problems with a combinatorial flavour to them. Causal set theory is based on this rather
