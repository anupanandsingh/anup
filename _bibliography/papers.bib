    abstract = {Lagrangian multiforms provide a variational framework to describe integrable
                hierarchies. The case of Lagrangian $1$-forms covers finite-dimensional
                integrable systems. We use the theory of Lie dialgebras introduced by
                Semenov-Tian-Shansky to construct a general Lagrangian $$1$$-form. Given a Lie
                dialgebra associated with a Lie algebra $$\mathfrak{g}$$ and a collection $H_k$,
                $k=1,\dots,N$, of invariant functions on $$\mathfrak{g}^*$$, we give a formula
                for a Lagrangian multiform describing the commuting flows for $H_k$ on a
                coadjoint orbit in $$\mathfrak{g}^*$$. We show that the Euler-Lagrange equations
                for our multiform produce the set of compatible equations in Lax form
                associated with the underlying $r$-matrix of the Lie dialgebra. We establish a
                structural result which relates the closure relation for our multiform to the
                Poisson involutivity of the Hamiltonians $H_k$ and the so-called "double
                zero" on the Euler-Lagrange equations. Lie dialgebras are related to Lie
                bialgebras but are more flexible in that they incorporate the case of
                non-skew-symmetric $r$-matrices. The Adler-Kostant-Symes (AKS) scheme is a
                particular case of the Lie dialgebra construction. We illustrate these points
                and our construction with the open Toda chain and the rational Gaudin model.
                The open Toda chain is constructed using two different Lie dialgebra structures
                on $\mathfrak{sl}(N+1)$. The first one possesses a non-skew-symmetric
                $r$-matrix and falls within the AKS scheme. The second one possesses a
                skew-symmetric $r$-matrix. In both cases, the connection with the well-known
                descriptions of the chain in Flaschka and canonical coordinates is provided.},
